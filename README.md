# BloxRT
A specialised version of Roblox for Windows-RT devices.
This is the side project I'm working on while RetroBlox is on paused development. RetroBlox is also a project which aims to bring Roblox functionality back to Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8.1 as they're not supported on any of those versions anymore.

Development code will be brought here soon.
